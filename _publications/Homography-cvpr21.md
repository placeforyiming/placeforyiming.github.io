# Self-supervised Geometric Features Discovery with Interpretable Attention for Vehicle Re-Identification and Beyond

## Abstract
To learn distinguishable patterns, most of recent works in vehicle re-identification (ReID) struggled to redevelop official benchmarks to provide various supervisions, which requires prohibitive human labors. In this paper, we seek to achieve the similar goal but do not involve more human efforts. To this end, we present a novel framework, which successfu
