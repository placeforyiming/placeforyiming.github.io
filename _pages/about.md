I'm a PhD candidate supervised by [Dr. Xinming Huang](https://users.wpi.edu/~xhuang/) at ECE Department of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. In the middle of my PhD from 05/2019 to 11/2019, I worked at iRobot as an intern supervised by [Dr. Stefan Zickler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G_vOcFUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I'm working on building various robotic vision systems to meet the requirement of my fundings. Specifically:
<ul>
  <li>I built a camera-centered online 3D semantic occupancy grid system for autonomous cars via solving the <b>depth completion task</b>. </li>
  <li>The counterpart LiDAR-centered system is built by solving the <b>point cloud panoptic segmentation task</b>. </li>
  <li>For UAV and geo-survey, I proposed a pixel-wise geo-localization system to align the onboard camera image with satellite maps by extending tradition Lucas-Kanade with neural networks (<b>deep homography task</b>).</li>
   <li> At iRobot, I built a label-free system to train a monocular depth prediction network by combining existing 3D reconstruction system with <b>self-supervised depth prediction task</b>.</li>
</ul>
 
 Besides those research projects, I also implemented several popular robotic vision models on demand, such as the 3D detector AVOD, the 2D YOLO series, and panoptic-Deeplab etc. Several of my research papers have been published on well-recognized conferences and journals, like CVPR and IEEE Robotic and Automation Letter. Some of my papers are still under review. Please see the Portfolio&Pub for details.

Master of Systems Science at BNU
======
I spent two years to get the master degree of systems science at Beijing Normal University. I published a good stochastic process data modeling paper as well as undertook several industiral projects.   

Bachelor of Physics at LZU
======
My undergraduate life at Lanzhou University is pure and enjoyable. I majored in math for two years, then transfered to physics for three years. This is an important period for me that I learned not only the scientific knowledge but also how human understand the world. More specific, I discard the idea that the physical world is determinable with universal truth and accept the fundamental uncertainty with inevitable observers' bias. I mean, physically, not socially. I won some scholars, such as the second prize of the national mathematical modeling. I also was a member of an undergraduate therotecal physics research project.
