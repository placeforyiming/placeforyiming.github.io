I am working as an Algorithm Engineering at HESAI Technology, a top-1 lidar company with wide-range businesses in general robotics. I'm trying very hard to build a functional safety perception system that can overcome the shortcomings of the general black-box style data-driven methods. Part of my working outputs have been delivered to our mass-product customers and largely improved the safety level of many running cars in the traffic. 

Got my Ph.D. degree from the ECE Department of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, supervised by [Dr. Xinming Huang](https://users.wpi.edu/~xhuang/). The projects during my Ph.D., including [depth completion](https://placeforyiming.github.io/publications/RAL-depth-completion/), [point cloud panoptic segmentation](https://placeforyiming.github.io/publications/point-cloud-panoptic-segmentation/), [localization with satellite](https://placeforyiming.github.io/publications/Homography-cvpr21/), explored how to utilize multi-discipline technics to solve challenging 3D perception problems for intelligent cars and drones. The specific knowledge lies in object detection, semantic segmentation, depth prediction/completion, image alignment, multi-view geometry, and point cloud processing. I have several papers published at premier conferences and journals in computer vision, robotics, and artificial intelligence, including CVPR, ICCV, ICRA, IROS, RAL, TNNLS, etc.

In the middle of my Ph.D. from 05/2019 to 11/2019, I worked at ***iRobot*** as a visual perception intern supervised by Dr. Stefan Zickler. During my internship, I worked on ***self-supervised depth prediction*** with ***3D reconstruction***.

Before starting my Ph.D. at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I studied math and physics for seven years and earned one Batchelor's degree in physics and one Master's degree in systems science. I got one publication in the New Journal of Physics aiming to explain the underlying principle of human movement behaviors from the physics perspective. The life of learning physics is enjoyable.

Master of Systems Science at BNU
======
I spent two years to get the master degree of systems science at Beijing Normal University. I published a good stochastic process data modeling paper as well as undertook several industiral projects.   

Bachelor of Physics at LZU
======
My undergraduate life at Lanzhou University is pure and enjoyable. I majored in math for two years, then transfered to physics for three years. This is an important period for me that I learned not only the scientific knowledge but also how human understand the world. More specific, I discard the idea that the physical world is determinable with universal truth and accept the fundamental uncertainty with inevitable observers' bias. I mean, physically, not socially. I won some scholars, such as the second prize of the national mathematical modeling. I also was a member of an undergraduate therotecal physics research project.
