I'm a Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Dr. Xinming Huang](https://users.wpi.edu/~xhuang/) at ECE Department of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Coping with this deep learning age, my projects during Ph.D. explored how to combine deep learning methods with classic vision models to solve hard core 3D robotic perception challengs, including [depth completion](https://placeforyiming.github.io/publications/RAL-depth-completion/), point cloud semantic segmentation, point cloud panoptic segmentation, and [localization with satellite](https://placeforyiming.github.io/publications/Homography-cvpr21/), etc. I have several papers published, accepted or under-review for premier conferences and journals in computer vision and robotics, including CVPR, IROS, RAL, etc.

In the middle of my Ph.D. from 05/2019 to 11/2019, I worked at ***iRobot*** as a visual preception intern supervised by Dr. Stefan Zickler. During my internship, I worked on ***self-supervised depth prediction*** with ***3D reconstruction***.

Before starting my Ph.D. in Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I studied in physics for several years. The life of learning physics is enjoyable.


<!---
Master of Systems Science at BNU
======
I spent two years to get the master degree of systems science at Beijing Normal University. I published a good stochastic process data modeling paper as well as undertook several industiral projects.   

Bachelor of Physics at LZU
======
My undergraduate life at Lanzhou University is pure and enjoyable. I majored in math for two years, then transfered to physics for three years. This is an important period for me that I learned not only the scientific knowledge but also how human understand the world. More specific, I discard the idea that the physical world is determinable with universal truth and accept the fundamental uncertainty with inevitable observers' bias. I mean, physically, not socially. I won some scholars, such as the second prize of the national mathematical modeling. I also was a member of an undergraduate therotecal physics research project.
