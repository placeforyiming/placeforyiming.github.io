Experiences
======
* May 2020 to March 2021 : ***Research Assistant*** supported by ***General Dynamics***
  * Build a visual system to pixel-wise localize camera image of UAV with satellite map.
  * The system is able to simultaneously learn invariance features from multi-modality image pairs.
  * Several computer vision technics are seamlessly assembled together, including hierarchy Lucas-Kanade, Homography Mapping, Spatial Transform Network, etc.  


* May 2019 to November 2019: ***Robotic Visual Perception Intern*** at ***iRobot*** 
  * Build a label-free training system for monocular depth prediction network.
  * The system works stably for both indoor and outdoor cases by combining 3D reconstruction (colmap) with self-supervised learning.


* Other Semesters of my PhD: ***Teaching Assistant*** at ***Worcester Polytechnic Institute*** 
  * Course co-designer of two graduate level courses: ECE579 and ECE545/CS545 which cover topics in machine learning and computer vision.
