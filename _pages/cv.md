Education
======
* Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 2021 (expected)
* M.S. in Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, 2016
* B.S. in Physics, Lanzhou University, 2014

Work experience
======
* May 2020 to March 2021 : Research Assistant supported by General Dynamic
  * Build a visual system to pixel-wise localize camera image of UAV with satellite map.
  * The system is able to simultaneously learn invariance features from multi-modal image pairs.
  * Several computer vision technics are seamlessly assembled together, including hierarchy Lucas-Kanade, Homography Mapping, Spatial Transform Network, etc.  


* May 2019 to November 2019: Visual Perception Intern at iRobot 
  * Build a label-free training system for monocular depth prediction network.
  * The system works stably for both indoor and outdoor cases by combining 3D reconstruction (colmap) with self-supervised learning.


* Other Semesters of my PhD: Teaching Assistant at Worcester Polytechnic Institute 
  * Course co-designer of two graduate level courses: ECE579 and ECE545/CS545 which cover topics in machine learning and computer vision.
  * General teaching assistant workload (grade, office hour, lab manager, etc) for several undergraduate courses: ECE2049, ECE 2029 and ECE 2010.
